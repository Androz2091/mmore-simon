In the PMI study of 984 US cigarette smokers, a 6.8% reduction in urinary 8-iso-PGF2\u03b1 was observed in those who switched to HTP use for 6 months as compared with those who continued to smoke cigarettes *(154)*. In the post-marketing study of real-world HTP use in Japan, the level of this biomarker was somewhat higher in HTP users than in non-users, albeit at borderline significance (P=0.0646) *(157)*.\n\n#### Indicators Of Preclinical Changes And Symptoms\n\nOther urinary biomarkers of oxidative stress. In DNA, guanine is the major target for direct oxidation by inflammation-induced radicals. The most abundant product of such oxidation is 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine, which can cause chromosomal aberrations and induce mutations and is widely used as a biomarker of oxidative stress *(115)*. Some studies have found significantly higher levels of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine in ENDS users than in nonsmokers *(161,162)*. Sakamaki-Ching et al. *(162)* found no difference in the levels of this biomarker between ENDS users and smokers.\n\n{120}\n\n\n\nDirect assessment of chronic disease outcomes due to the use of ENDS\nand HTPs requires prospective cohort studies, which last many years and involve large numbers of participants. As this is not feasible in most studies and not suitable for time-sensitive regulatory decisions, indicators of preclinical changes and symptoms have commonly been used as surrogate measures of respiratory and cardiovascular risk in users of tobacco and nicotine products. Preclinical indicators and symptoms of cardiovascular disease may include such measures as blood pressure, heart rate, arterial stiffness, platelet reactivity and other cardiovascular outcomes.\n\n[2]  *(162)* found no difference in the levels of this biomarker between ENDS users and smokers.\n\n{120}\n\n\n\nDirect assessment of chronic disease outcomes due to the use of ENDS\nand HTPs requires prospective cohort studies, which last many years and involve large numbers of participants. As this is not feasible in most studies and not suitable for time-sensitive regulatory decisions, indicators of preclinical changes and symptoms have commonly been used as surrogate measures of respiratory and cardiovascular risk in users of tobacco and nicotine products. Preclinical indicators and symptoms of cardiovascular disease may include such measures as blood pressure, heart rate, arterial stiffness, platelet reactivity and other cardiovascular outcomes. For respiratory diseases such as COPD, commonly measured preclinical indicators and symptoms include respiratory function (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC and diffusing capacity of the lung for CO (DLCO), as well as coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath and other symptoms *(163\u2013166)*. Interpretation of cardiopulmonary preclinical indicators is often based on lipid profile, fibrinogen, D-dimer and hs-CRP. There are no robust preclinical indicators of cancer. Reports of large populationbased epidemiological studies of the association between ENDS use and disease outcomes are becoming available, most of which have been published since 2020. Such emerging data will play a key role in future assessments of the predictive value of biomarkers of exposure and biological effects in studies of novel and emerging tobacco products.\n\nENDS users. Several studies have shown that ENDS use increases blood pressure, heart rate, arterial stiffness, platelet reactivity and other cardiovascular outcomes as compared with no tobacco or nicotine product use (141,147,148,167,168). Respiratory effects and symptoms (e.g.\n\n[3] smokers than in those of non-smokers, but interpretation was complicated as, in some cases, the numbers of subjects were small or the methods lacked appropriate validation.\n\nCytokines, chemokines and reactive proteins. Inflammation and oxidative damage are significant factors in various diseases caused by cigarette smoking, including cancer, cardiovascular disease and COPD. The processes involve infiltration of lymphocytes, macrophages and neutrophils into tissues under stress and secretion of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and other factors. Such biomarkers are commonly measured in plasma or serum, and some - such as interleukin (IL)-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) - are significantly higher in smokers than in nonsmokers *(107)*. The levels of these biomarkers have been directly linked to various relevant diseases. For example, CRP, BCA-1/CXCL13, MDC/CCL22 and IL-1RA have been prospectively associated with the risk of lung cancer *(108)*. In relation to cardiovascular disease (CVD), oxidized LDL is a representative indicator of lipid profiles *(109)*, and CRP, IL-6, fibrinogen and soluble ICAM-1 are indicators of thrombosis and endothelial dysfunction, which play a basic role in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis, vasoconstriction and coronary heart disease *(110\u2013114)*. COPD is associated with elevated IL- 8, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and RANTES (\"regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted\"), reflecting a predominance of macrophages and T cells, which are correlated with the degree of airflow obstruction and emphysema and appear to play a predominant role in apoptosis, leading to lung destruction *(115\u2013124)*. COPD is also characterized by increases in fibrinogen, which is associated with reduced lung function *(118\u2013121,125\u2013131)*.\n\nUrinary prostaglandin metabolites.\n\n[4]  These variables relative to oxygen uptake may assess the respiratory mechanisms involved when fitness is impaired.\n\nCardiovascular parameters such as cardiac output, heart rate and pressure in systemic and pulmonary circulation need to be measured for the analysis of the more fundamental haemodynamic variables. These measurements require invasive methods and their use is therefore limited to specialized hospital laboratories. However, some other circulatory measurements are easily taken and may yield significant insight into cardiovascular functioning during physical activity.\n\nHeart rate may simply be counted during exercise by palpation of the carotid artery or by auscultation of the heart sounds. It is preferable, however, to record exercise heart rate by means of an electrocardiograph.\n\nThe monitoring of the electrocardiogram (ECG) during an exercise test makes an important contribution to the safety of the test. Telemetry systems for ECG transmission or cardiocorders (miniature ECG tape recorders carried by the subject) have the advantage that they free the subject from the encumbrance of wires and cables.\n\nBlood pressure measured in the brachial artery by the cuff method should be taken whenever possible and recorded because during and after exercise it\n\n{146}\n\n\n\nis an indicator of health status. The use of the cuff method to measure brachial artery pressure during exercise has certain disadvantages. Only systolic pressure can be assessed with reasonable accuracy during the performance of exercise tests.\n\nAn ECG taken during and after exercise stress testing is widely used in the diagnosis of ischaemic heart disease. It is also used as a health risk indicator because a normal exercise ECG is associated with a low, and an abnormal ECG (particularly ST depressions) with an increased risk of heart attacks.\n\nExercise Stress Tests In Population Surveys\n===========================================\n\nTo measure positive aspects of health on a population basis for the purpose of evaluating fitness and assessing the effect of health promotion programmes, exercise testing has to be simple. Many subjects should be able to be tested within a reasonable period of time. The methods must be acceptable to young and old, whether fit or unfit. Safety precautions, environmental specifications and the preparation of subjects for testing are further described in a manual published by WHO (7).\n\nMany different exercise stress tests have been worked out for measuring physical performance capacity. From a physiological point of view, the test should be selected according to how validly and reliably it measures maximal aerobic power.\n\n\n\n[5] #### Table 3.4 Risk Of Bias Table Anhmrc 1989\n\n{106}\n\n\n\n#### Table 3.5 Benetos 1992\n\n| CHD | coronary heart disease |\n|-------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| CI | confidence interval |\n| CVD | cardiovascular disease |\n| DASH | Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension |\n| GRADE | Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and |\n| | Evaluation |\n| HDL | high-density lipoprotein |\n| HIV | human immunodeficiency virus |\n| ICTRP | International Clinical Trials Registry Platform |\n| IQR | interquartile range |\n| ITT | intention-to-treat |\n\n| NCD | noncommunicable disease |\n|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| PRISMA | preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses |\n| RCT | randomized controlled trial |\n| SD | standard deviation |\n| VLDL | very low-density lipoprotein |\n| WHO | World Health Organization |\n| Symbols | |\n| > | greater than |\n\n#### Table 3.6 Risk Of Bias Table Benetos 1992\n\n{107}\n\n\n\n#### Table 3.7 Cappuccio 1997\n\n| 3.8.1 | Characteristics of included studies |\n|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Table 3.1 | Andersson 1984 |\n| Methods | Parallel study design of reduced sodium, fat and carbohydrate diet and participants |\n| | randomized to sodium tablets or not; conducted in Sweden |\n| Participants | 23 adults with hypertension not taking medication to control blood pressure and all |\n| | 20\u201340% overweight |\n| Interventions | Group 1 - reduced sodium, fat and carbohydrate diet plus sodium tablets (control) |\n| | Group 2 - reduced sodium, fat and carbohydrate diet (reduced sodium) |\n| Outcomes | Resting blood pressure |\n| | Left ventricular hypertrophy |\n| | Haemodynamic indicators |\n| | Urinary noradrenaline |\n| | Plasma noradrenaline |\n| | Cardiac output |\n| | Mean arterial pressure |\n| Notes | 1) Sodium reduction achieved: > 1/3 of control |\n| | > 2 g/day in intervention |\n| | > 1.2 g/day in intervention |\n",

    "context": "[1]  This may be relevant not just for policy-makers in ministries of health but also for those working in other government areas such as social welfare.\n\nWithin a ministry of health, it may be helpful to check whether self-management support is promoted across all chronic conditions or limited to a single condition such as diabetes. This may occur if the ministry is organized in vertical disease-specific programmes. Sharing learning and resources across disease-specific programmes may encourage the rollout of selfmanagement support across a health system.\n\nOther policies or approaches in a ministry in charge of health or other government ministry can also play a part in facilitating or hindering the rollout of self-management support and therapeutic patient education programmes. For example, policies that address health financing,\n\nBox 11. What Kinds Of Therapeutic Patient Education Programme Are Likely To Succeed?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLarge-scale initiatives suggest that self-management support programmes that are most likely to succeed:\n- are promoted by policy, thus ensuring meaningful adoption (and ideally provision of resources and reimbursement of costs) by health services;\n- provide training programmes for professionals; and - focus on structured self-management education for patients in the context of overall disease management and are sufficiently flexible to address local, cultural and personal variation.\n\nSource: Taylor et al. (4).\n\nworkforce and professional training and quality improvement may all be relevant. In some countries, a ministry in charge of education may be responsible for undergraduate education for health professionals and, therefore, may need to be involved in any changes to course content. The specific impact of these policy areas is discussed in more detail later in this chapter and in Chapter 7.\n\nPolicy leaders working across these agendas should ensure that aims and priorities are aligned across different areas and ministries in order to successfully embed therapeutic patient education into routine clinical care.\n\nEngaging people with lived experience of chronic conditions to act as advocates in policy or strategy development may provide an important lever to bring about change by highlighting their needs related to self-management support (Case study 9).\n\nA national person-centred guided selfmanagement programme that includes therapeutic patient education is more effective in achieving improved health outcomes than conventional treatment guidelines alone *(108)*.\n\n[2]  Promote patient autonomy, and the role of the family and community, in decisionmaking related to both clinical management and programme implementation.\n9. Stimulate and foster effective global, regional and national partnerships between public and private sectors, civil society and other stakeholders to improve access to treatments, diagnostics, and information and communication technologies.\n10. Support research and development related to innovative intervention strategies and ensure the dissemination of findings.\n11. Monitor and evaluate all aspects, ensuring timely feedback to relevant stakeholders.\n\n{166}\n\n\n\n### Added Value Of The Global Initiative\n\nThe initiative has added value in that it will:\n- give visibility to the need to improve the management of chronic diseases;\n- define public health priorities in chronic diseases;\n- integrate the management of chronic diseases into primary health care; - unify existing approaches to the care of patients with chronic diseases;\n- improve the quality of care of patients with chronic diseases;\n- involve patients, families and communities; - mitigate the socioeconomic impacts of chronic diseases; - be linked to policy at every stage; - be linked to the critical components of the health system at all levels;\n- create links between the Millennium Development Goals and chronic diseases by addressing health care inequalities associated with poverty.\n\n### Target Diseases\n\nThe initiative should target a core list of chronic diseases, with the addition of supplementary chronic diseases based on local or regional need and availability of resources. The selection of diseases for inclusion in the initiative should be based on the following criteria:\n- Burden of disease data (morbidity and mortality) which show that the disease is a major public health issue.\n\n* Effective evidence-based interventions exist for both the disease and its risk factors.\n\nThe core chronic diseases and conditions targeted by the initiative will be:\n- cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart diseases, high cardiovascular risk);\n- type 1 and type 2 diabetes;\n- asthma.\n\nChronic diseases which may be added to this list are:\n- epilepsy; - depression; - cancer; - glaucoma.\n\n{167}\n\n\n\nCancer represents a special case for which prevention and treatment are more difficult to incorporate into an integrated approach to chronic disease. In this respect, palliative care represents an opportunity for intervention that should be acted upon, particularly with regard to improving access to morphine.\n\n### Implementation\n\n\n\n[3] ----------------------\n\nSeveral global and WHO European Region health policies and initiatives provide contextual background for the provision of therapeutic patient education services for chronic conditions and NCDs.\n\nAt global level, the three United Nations high-level meetings and resolutions on the prevention and control of NCDs *(27\u201329)* in 2011, 2014 and 2018 acknowledged the burden of NCDs and reaffirmed the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.\n\nThe Sustainable Development Goals were adopted in 2015; within Goal 3 on good health and well-being are the associated Target 3.4 to reduce the risk of premature mortality from major NCDs by one third by 2030 and Target 3.8 to achieve universal health coverage (30). In a 2020 follow-up report, the lack of progress demonstrated by countries suggested that many health systems are not keeping pace with the rising NCD burden *(31)*.\n\nThe WHO Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases 2013\u20132030 *(32,33)* recommends taking action to empower people with NCDs to manage their own condition better, and to provide education, incentives and tools for self-care and selfmanagement; this is echoed in the equivalent WHO European Region action plan on NCDs (34). Regarding specific chronic conditions, World\n\n{639}\n\n\n\nHealth Assembly resolution 74/4 (2021) related to diabetes urged Member States to, among other things, strengthen health systems and high-quality, integrated and people-centred primary health services for all; ensure an adequate and well-trained and equipped health workforce; and strengthen health promotion and improve health literacy, including through ensuring access to understandable and high-quality, patient-friendly information and education *(35)*.\n\nThe WHO Thirteenth General Programme of Work, 2019\u20132023 *(36)* and the European Programme of Work 2020\u20132025 *(37)* both have a strong focus on the achievement of universal health coverage, and there have been both global *(38,39)* and WHO European Region *(40)* frameworks for strengthening people-centred health services. Furthermore, the European Programme of Work also sets out flagship initiatives on empowerment through digital health to support countries in digital transformation for better health (41) and on healthier behaviour that takes account of social, behavioural and cultural factors, including health literacy, in understanding human behaviour (42).\n\n{640}\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n[4] Information activities will include the development of indicators, training in epidemiology, and better collection, linkage and dissemination of data.\n\n#### 3.2.4 Action Priorities\n\nThe major priority will be to strengthen intersectoral action for the prevention of noncommunicable diseases, especially through the Countrywide Integrated Noncommunicable Disease Intervention (CINDI) Programme. Another important action priority will be efforts to achieve eradication of poliomyelitis, and the strengthening of programmes on immunization (regional Expanded Programme on Immunization). There will be action in regard to a number of specific diseases, notably to follow up the St Vincent Declaration on diabetes (see EU R /R C41 /10 ). The Office will continue to cooperate with countries on disaster preparedness and emergency relief operations.\n\n{80}\n\n\n\n#### 3.3 Lifestyles Conducive To Health (Hfa Targets 13-17)\n\n### 3.3.1 Focus On Health Promotion\n\n#### 3.3.2 Settings For Health Promotion 3.3.3 Action To Support Positive Lifestyles\n\n### 3.4.1 Policy Development\n\n#### 3.4.2 Environmental Health Information\n\nEfforts will be concentrated on developing new forms of organization and methods of financing for health promotion. In line with the recommendations of the Ottawa, Adelaide and Sundsvall conferences there will be intensified efforts to ensure close collaboration with sectors other than health. Emphasis will also be laid on psychosocial factors, individual coping capabilities, and the mental health aspects of social action. The overall aim will be to find ways of ensuring a more integrated national effort to provide true intersectoral support for healthy living.\n\nThe Healthy Cities project will continue, given its success as a clear focus of action for lifestyles and health promotion, and will actively reach out to the countries of central and eastern Europe in cooperation with the Council of Europe. The European network of health-promoting schools being set up jointly with the European Community, the Council of Europe and other partners will become fully operational, strengthening coverage of the educational sector and young people. Health promotion will also be developed in additional settings, including industrial and other workplaces (see section 3.4.4 relating to health of people at work).\n\nThe action plan on tobacco will be continued and efforts intensified to better publicize its implementation.\n\n[5] Policy leaders working across these agendas should ensure that aims and priorities are aligned across different areas and ministries in order to successfully embed therapeutic patient education into routine clinical care.\n\nEngaging people with lived experience of chronic conditions to act as advocates in policy or strategy development may provide an important lever to bring about change by highlighting their needs related to self-management support (Case study 9).\n\nA national person-centred guided selfmanagement programme that includes therapeutic patient education is more effective in achieving improved health outcomes than conventional treatment guidelines alone *(108)*. Examples of this kind of approach can be found across Europe, such as the Diabetes Management Programme in Germany (109) or the National Asthma Programme in Finland *(110)*.\n\nStrategies to support self-management through therapeutic patient education can also contribute to other strategic aims such as patient empowerment and raising the levels of health literacy *(69)*. They may also achieve broader health goals such as promoting digital health, active citizenship and meaningful engagement\n\n{674}\n\n\n\nCase Study 9. The European Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Charter\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPatient advocacy groups play an important role in supporting patients with chronic diseases and promoting better care. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and irreversible chronic lung disease that mainly affects people aged over 65 years. People with IPF often struggle to receive a diagnosis and have to cope with a life-limiting, rapidly progressive illness with few support structures.\n\nIn a patient\u2013physician initiative in 2014, advocacy groups in European countries were interviewed about inequalities and unmet needs in diagnosis and treatment, resulting in the creation of the IPF Patient Charter *(107)*. The final version of the Charter was presented to 26 Members of the European Parliament in September 2014 and in December 2020, by which time it had collected 35 000 signatures.\n\nSource: Mr Kjeld Hansen, Chair, European Lung Foundation, Oslo, Norway, personal communication, 18 July 2022 (reproduced with permission).\n\nof people living with chronic conditions *(111),* and addressing health inequalities.\n\nThe promotion of digital health for therapeutic patient education can have benefits across the health system, and governments and academic bodies may wish to support more implementation research programmes on developing and evaluating new technologies for therapeutic patient education. However, digitalization of health does entail a risk of increasing health inequalities and inequities because of the varying levels of digital health literacy (112).\n\n",
    "answer": "Health promotion efforts can support the prevention of chronic conditions like diabetes in several ways:\n\n1. **Education and Awareness**: Health promotion initiatives can educate the public about the risk factors associated with diabetes, such as obesity, physical inactivity, and poor dietary choices. Raising awareness can motivate individuals to make healthier lifestyle choices.\n\n2. **Promoting Healthy Lifestyles**: Programs that encourage physical activity, healthy eating, and weight management can directly impact the prevention of diabetes. Community-based initiatives, such as fitness programs or nutrition workshops, can help individuals adopt healthier behaviors.\n\n3. **Community Engagement**: Involving families and communities in health promotion can foster a supportive environment that encourages healthy behaviors. Community engagement strategies can include support groups, health fairs, and partnerships with local organizations to promote health initiatives.\n\n4. **Access to Resources**: Health promotion can enhance access to resources such as healthy food options, recreational facilities, and healthcare services. Policies that improve access to these resources can help individuals make healthier choices.\n\n5. **Intersectoral Collaboration**: Health promotion efforts can collaborate with sectors beyond health, including education, agriculture, and urban planning, to create environments conducive to healthy living. For example, creating safe spaces for physical activity in urban areas can encourage more people to engage in exercise.\n\n6. **Monitoring and Evaluation**: Implementing systems to monitor health outcomes can help assess the effectiveness of health promotion initiatives. Gathering data on health behaviors and outcomes can inform policy decisions and improve future programs.\n\n7. **Empowerment and Self-Management**: Health promotion can empower individuals with the knowledge and skills to manage their health proactively. This includes providing training and resources for self-management education, helping individuals take charge of their health decisions.\n\n8. **Policy Development**: Advocating for and implementing policies that support health promotion, such as regulations on food marketing, taxes on sugary drinks, and incentives for physical activity, can create a broader impact on the prevention of chronic conditions like diabetes.\n\nBy integrating these strategies, health promotion efforts can play a significant role in reducing the incidence of diabetes and improving overall public health outcomes.",
